# SocketClientServerProject
A solution file that contains a server and a client for a simple socket game!

The client will connect to a server with proper handling of errors.

The client's objective is to guess the number that the server generates.
The server will reply with -1, 0 ,1 which the client automatically converts to user friendly data.

How many guesses will it take you to guess the servers number!?
